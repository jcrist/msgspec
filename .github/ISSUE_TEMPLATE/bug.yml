        When possible, please also include a [minimal, complete, verifiable
        example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).
        Ideally this should be code that can be run without modification to
        demonstrate the problem.


        When including errors and tracebacks, please include the _full
        traceback_ as well as the code that generated the error (or at least
        the line that caused it).
