msgspec
=======

``msgspec`` is a *fast* serialization and validation library, with builtin
support for JSON_, MessagePack_, YAML_, and TOML_. It features:

- üöÄ **High performance encoders/decoders** for common protocols. The JSON and
  MessagePack implementations regularly :doc:`benchmark <benchmarks>` as the
  fastest options for Python.

- üéâ **Support for a wide variety of Python types**. Additional types may
  be supported through :doc:`extensions <extending>`.

- üîç **Zero-cost schema validation** using familiar Python type annotations.
  In :doc:`benchmarks <benchmarks>` ``msgspec`` decodes *and* validates JSON
  ~2x faster than orjson_ can decode it alone.

- ‚ú® **A speedy Struct type** for representing structured data. If you already
  use dataclasses_ or attrs_, :doc:`structs` should feel familiar. However,
  they're :ref:`10-100x <struct-benchmark>` faster for common operations.

All of this is included in a :ref:`lightweight library
<benchmark-library-size>` with no required dependencies.

-----

``msgspec`` may be used for serialization alone, as a faster JSON or
MessagePack library. For the greatest benefit though, we recommend using
``msgspec`` to handle the full serialization & validation workflow:

**Define** your message schemas using standard Python type annotations.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import msgspec

    >>> class User(msgspec.Struct):
    ...     """A new type describing a User"""
    ...     name: str
    ...     groups: set[str] = set()
    ...     email: str | None = None

**Encode** messages as JSON, or one of the many other supported protocols.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> alice = User("alice", groups={"admin", "engineering"})

    >>> alice
    User(name='alice', groups={"admin", "engineering"}, email=None)

    >>> msg = msgspec.json.encode(alice)

    >>> msg
    b'{"name":"alice","groups":["admin","engineering"],"email":null}'

**Decode** messages back into Python objects, with optional schema validation.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> msgspec.json.decode(msg, type=User)
    User(name='alice', groups={"admin", "engineering"}, email=None)

    >>> msgspec.json.decode(b'{"name":"bob","groups":[123]}', type=User)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    msgspec.ValidationError: Expected `str`, got `int` - at `$.groups[0]`

``msgspec`` is designed to be as performant as possible, while retaining some
of the nicities of validation libraries like pydantic_. For supported types,
encoding/decoding a message with ``msgspec`` can be :doc:`~10-80x faster than
alternative libraries <benchmarks>`.

Highlights
----------

- ``msgspec`` is **fast**. It :doc:`benchmarks <benchmarks>` as the fastest
  serialization library for Python, outperforming all other JSON/MessagePack
  libraries compared.

- ``msgspec`` is **friendly**. Through use of Python's type annotations,
  messages are :ref:`validated <typed-decoding>` during deserialization in a
  declarative way. ``msgspec`` also works well with other type-checking tooling
  like mypy_ and pyright_, providing excellent editor integration.

- ``msgspec`` is **flexible**. It natively supports a :doc:`wide range of
  Python builtin types <supported-types>`. Support for additional types can
  also be added through :doc:`extensions <extending>`.

- ``msgspec`` is **lightweight**. It has no required dependencies, and the
  binary size is :ref:`a fraction of that of comparable libraries
  <benchmark-library-size>`.

- ``msgspec`` is **correct**. The encoders/decoders implemented are strictly
  compliant with their respective specifications, providing stronger guarantees
  of compatibility with other systems.
